<!-- To use in future  -->
<!-- Hi there! I'm passionate about all things tech and have been hooked on computers since the age of 10. I recently completed my IT studies and am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world projects.

Aside from coding and problem-solving, I enjoy exploring the great outdoors through martial arts, hiking, and bushcraft. When I'm not outside, you can find me tinkering with Linux and discovering new ways to optimize my system.

I'm always on the lookout for new ideas and opportunities to learn and grow. Thanks for stopping by! -->
