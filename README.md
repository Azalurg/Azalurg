# Hello there 👋

Hi, my name is Patryk, and I recently graduated in Computer Science from Gdańsk University. Since my early days, I have been captivated by modern technology, computers, and the vast world of informatics. Alongside my passion for IT, I am passionate about bushcraft, MMA, and fantasy.

At this stage of my career, I am eager to delve into various IT roles and professions, such as backend development, DevOps, cybersecurity, and even OS development. With youth and unlimited energy on my side, I am determined to make the most of every opportunity.

If you are looking for a dedicated individual to join your startup, business, or company, feel free to reach out to me. Let's collaborate and make great things happen together!
